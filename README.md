# HeroClone v0.0

An adventure game for 2-5 players

## Where we're at
This project is being undertaken in the pursuit of familiarizing ourselves with Java-based web applications, Tomcat, and Spring WEBMVC/Security.

As of version 0.0, this is a simple proof of concept STS project that incorporates basic JSTL, and initializes a Spring WEBMVC application. Our hope is to keep this running and turn it into a real live game. Keep an eye out!
